## Overview
Following the shift to remote work and study, people often spend hours at their desks without breaks.  
This project uses sensors + MQTT + Adafruit IO to provide real-time feedback on hydration, posture, and air comfort.

- **NodeMCU ESP8266** for WiFi + MQTT communication
- **DHT11 sensor** ‚Üí Temperature & Humidity  
- **Moisture sensor** ‚Üí Detects presence of a water glass  
- **Ultrasonic distance sensor** ‚Üí Monitors screen distance  
- **Adafruit IO** ‚Üí Dashboard, controls, and alerts  


##  Features
-  Real-time data logging to Adafruit IO  
-  Custom ‚Äúmodes‚Äù (Focus, Relax, Sleep) that adjust thresholds  
-  Alerts for hydration, screen distance, and air comfort  
-  Simulated + physical prototypes

##  Hardware Setup
- **NodeMCU ESP8266**  
- **Breadboard**  
- **DHT11 Temp/Humidity Sensor**  
- **Soil Moisture Sensor** (used for water detection)  
- **HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Distance Sensor**

## üöÄ How to Run
1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/desk-health-assistant.git
   cd desk-health-assistant

    Add your Adafruit IO credentials in secrets.h (Arduino) or export them as env variables for the Python simulator.

    Run the Python simulator:

    cd Simulators/py
    source venv/bin/activate
    python desk_health_sim.py

    Or upload the Arduino code to NodeMCU.
